### PBL Sprint 0 / Week 0
1. Couldn’t install homebrew, watched this video: https://youtu.be/bj3BzUDX0S8?si=iRsoMDOY0kgiqF8s
Went to Github.com to make a new repository, clicked on settings, clicked on build and development under pages, forked nighthawkcoders/student, entered a subdomain, and pressed Enforce HTTPS. For my page, I use a local host.
2. Struggled with Python installation - when checking for python, I used the code “python –versioon” and it kept saying Python 2.7.4.
3. To install python 3, I used this webpage: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
As well as https://www.codecademy.com/article/install-python3.
Used pip3 install jupyterlab to install Jupyter Notebooks
