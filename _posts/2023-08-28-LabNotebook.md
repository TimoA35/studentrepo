### Lab Notebook
Week 0

1. Couldn’t install homebrew, watched this video: https://youtu.be/bj3BzUDX0S8?si=iRsoMDOY0kgiqF8s

Went to Github.com to make a new repository, clicked on settings, clicked on build and development under pages, forked nighthawkcoders/student, entered a subdomain, and pressed Enforce HTTPS. For my page, I use a local host. 

2. Struggled with Python installation - when checking for python, I used the code “python –versioon” and it kept saying Python 2.7.4. 

3. To install python 3, I used this webpage: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
As well as https://www.codecademy.com/article/install-python3.
Used pip3 install jupyterlab to install Jupyter Notebooks

Week 1
1. Tech Talk - talked about opening jupyter notebooks and the quiz at the bottom of the python hello section

rsp = question_with_response("What command is used to evaluate correct or incorrect response in this example?")
if rsp == "if":
    print(rsp + " is correct!")
    correct += 1
else:
    print(rsp + " is incorrect!")

rsp = question_with_response("Each 'if' command contains an '_________' to determine a true or false condition?")
if rsp == "expression":
    print(rsp + " is correct!")
    correct += 1
else:
    print(rsp + " is incorrect!")

*Correct answer - if ____ - ____ is the answer


2. For github page, I added my drawing to the home page and made my first blog including info from my summer trip. 

3. Accidentally committed everything prematurely and ruined the website but got some help from my partner to fix it and undo the change. 

4. For my theme, I searched online and used “leap day”


Week 2

1. One issue I had was an error with "nav_home.html." Every time I hit make, it would take a while and pop up with an error. That's when I went up to Mr.Mortensin and asked for help, which he then used command f to find the problem.

2. Added car prcies hack and figured out how to change the code so added a new car.
