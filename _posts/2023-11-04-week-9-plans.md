Plans Week 2:
Split Work -
Aditya Ramesh - Create data models for cars, users, and reservation system.
Tanav - Develop user login system and implement database to save
reservations.
Tim - Create a weekly blueprint and add more cars to the HTML database.
Aditya D - Develop sysmem for users to keep their cars stored.
Sai - Start working on car lisitings for website and create a background.
Week Two Reflection -
Overall more of a work heavy week. After review with Mort, we can see that we are still working way too much on the frontend and need to focus on
implementing backend to make it one smooth world, not two.
