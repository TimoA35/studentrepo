### About Me
My name is Timo Al-Faraje. I was born on April 22, 2008. I am Syrian American, born in San Diego with both of my parents born in Syria. I wrestle as a sport, but enjoy watching sports like soccer and basketball. In summer, I went to istanbul for my third year in a row. It's one of my favorite cities because it combines the islamic and ottoman history of the state with a new modern city like New York. I enjoyed spending good time with family and friends as well as visitng palaces and museums. After I came back from my visit, I cleared my bags, ordered my notebooks, and prepared myself for the school year. I took this class because I believe I could have an interest in computer science as a career after high school; essentially discovering my passions. 


The following is a video of the beautiful blue waters of the bosphorus and green scenery of Istanbul:
