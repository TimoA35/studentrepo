1. Struggled with Python installation - when checking for python, I used the code “python –versioon” and it kept saying Python 2.7.4. To install python 3, I used this webpage: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
2. As well as https://www.codecademy.com/article/install-python3.
Used pip3 install jupyterlab to install Jupyter Notebooks
